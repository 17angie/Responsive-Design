# Responsive-Design

In this module challenge you will continue working on your porfolio website to make it compatible for different browswer widths.

## User Interface and Git

## Responsive Design

## Objectives

- describe the differences in fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive layouts
- implement media queries in a project.
- describe and use responsive units (px, em, rem, %, and vw.vh) to create a fully responsive website

## Introduction

In this challenge you will refactor your personal portfolio code to make it responsive. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

New features of a project should occur in a new branch in the same repository. Follow these steps to set up and work on your project from yesterday:

- [ ] `cd` into your personal portfolio repository
- [ ] Create a new branch from `<firstName-lastName>`:

```bash
git checkout -b <firstName-lastName-day2> <firstName-lastName>.
```

- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName-day2>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName-day2>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Today you will continue working on your portfolio site and add the much-needed feature of mobile compatibility.

- [ ] Insert a viewport meta tag into the head of the project with these html attributes: content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
- [ ] Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px
- [ ] Change CSS styles from hard-coded `px` to any one of the responsive units learned today

Your final product should be presentable at both mobile-width and a desktop-width.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

Once you finish the minimum viable project, work on any of the following stretch goals:

- [ ]  Test your website at several breakpoints and refactor code as needed. A few common breakpoints are below:
  - [ ]  iPhone: 360Ã—640
  - [ ]  Laptop: 1366Ã—768
  - [ ]  Widescreen: 1920Ã—1080
- [ ] Add accessability features to your webpage
- [ ] Start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like. I recommend making a branch of all your content in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate

- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
